## About This Project

This repository documents my personal journey in learning and applying DevOps & CloudOps practices, methodologies, and toolkit through a practical, evolving project.

The ultimate goal is to demonstrate the integration of CI/CD processes, Infrastructure as Code (IaC), cloud infrastructure, and monitoring, metric collection and analysis ‚Äî all added progressively as I advance in my skills.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This is not a reference implementation. It may contain mistakes or suboptimal decisions, which I intend to revisit and improve over time.

To support this learning process, I‚Äôve chosen to deploy [Immich](https://github.com/immich-app/immich) ‚Äî a high-performance, self-hosted solution for managing personal photo and video libraries.

Many thanks to the Immich team for their work on this great application.

## üõ†Ô∏è Current State

At this stage, the project has been completely restructured and is being built from scratch in the AWS Cloud. Work in progress...

More technical details can be found in the [archived/](./archived) (DEPRECATED!) directory and in the [DEVLOG](devlog.md).

## üìå Near-term plans

This section outlines the key objectives I plan to tackle next as I continue improving the project:

- **Migration to AWS Cloud**  
  Designing the entire infrastructure from scratch in Amazon Web Services Cloud. 





These tasks represent the immediate next steps in the ongoing development of this project.
